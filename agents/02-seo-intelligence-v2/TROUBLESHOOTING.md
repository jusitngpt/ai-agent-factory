## 1. Workflow Execution Issues

### 1.1 Workflow Not Triggering on Schedule

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow doesn't execute on Monday 9 AM as expected
- No execution logs for scheduled time
- Slack notifications not received on schedule

**Possible Causes:**
- Workflow not activated
- Trigger node configured incorrectly
- Timezone mismatch
- n8n instance not running (self-hosted)

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check Workflow Active Status:**
   ```
   n8n → Workflows → Agent-2 SEO Intelligence V2
   → Verify toggle shows "Active" (not "Inactive")
   ```
   - If inactive, click toggle to activate

2. **Verify Schedule Trigger Configuration:**
   ```
   Click Node 1 (Schedule Trigger)
   → Check:
   - Mode: "Every Week"
   - Day: Monday
   - Hour: 9
   - Minute: 0
   - Timezone: [Your timezone]
   ```

3. **Check Timezone Settings:**
   ```
   Compare:
   - Schedule trigger timezone
   - n8n instance timezone
   - Your local timezone
   ```
   - Common issue: Trigger set to UTC but expecting local time
   - Solution: Set trigger timezone explicitly

4. **Verify n8n Instance Running (Self-Hosted):**
   ```bash
   # Check if n8n is running
   ps aux | grep n8n

   # Check logs for errors
   journalctl -u n8n -f

   # Restart if needed
   systemctl restart n8n
   ```

5. **Check Execution Queue:**
   ```
   n8n → Executions → Check for any "Waiting" status
   ```
   - If executions queued, check queue settings
   - Increase concurrency if needed

**Verification:**
- Manual test: Click "Execute Workflow" to verify it runs
- Check next scheduled execution time in workflow list
- Monitor for next scheduled execution

**Prevention:**
- Set calendar reminder for expected execution time
- Configure n8n monitoring/alerts
- Use n8n Cloud (99.9% uptime) if self-hosting unreliable

### 1.2 Workflow Fails Immediately

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow execution starts but fails within seconds
- Error shown on Node 1 or Node 2
- No data passes to subsequent nodes

**Possible Causes:**
- Syntax error in competitor array (Node 2)
- Invalid JSON structure
- Missing required fields in competitor data

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check Node 2 (Competitor Array Setup):**
   ```javascript
   // Common syntax errors:

   // ❌ Missing comma between objects
   {
     name: "Selenium"
   }
   {
     name: "Cypress"
   }

   // ✅ Correct
   {
     name: "Selenium"
   },
   {
     name: "Cypress"
   }

   // ❌ Trailing comma in array
   competitors: [
     {...},
     {...},  // ← Remove this comma
   ]

   // ✅ Correct
   competitors: [
     {...},
     {...}   // ← No comma on last item
   ]
   ```

2. **Validate JSON Structure:**
   - Copy code from Node 2
   - Paste into JSON validator: https://jsonlint.com/
   - Fix any syntax errors reported

3. **Verify Required Fields:**
   ```javascript
   // Each competitor must have:
   {
     name: "string",              // ✅ Required
     website: "url",              // ✅ Required
     focus_areas: ["array"],      // ✅ Required
     primary_keywords: ["array"], // ✅ Required
     content_hub: "url"           // ✅ Required
   }
   ```

4. **Check for Special Characters:**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Unescaped quotes
   name: "Competitor's Name"

   // ✅ Escaped quotes
   name: "Competitor\'s Name"
   // OR
   name: "Competitor's Name"  // Use smart quotes
   ```

5. **Test with Minimal Data:**
   ```javascript
   // Temporarily use single competitor
   return [{
     json: {
       competitors: [{
         name: "Test",
         website: "https://example.com/",
         focus_areas: ["test"],
         primary_keywords: ["test keyword"],
         content_hub: "https://example.com/blog/"
       }],
       analysis_date: new Date().toISOString(),
       analysis_type: "weekly_seo_intelligence"
     }
   }];
   ```

**Verification:**
- Execute workflow with test data
- Verify Node 2 shows success (green checkmark)
- Check output data contains competitor array
- Restore full competitor list once working

---

### 1.3 Workflow Fails Partway Through Loop

**Symptoms:**
- First 1-2 competitors processed successfully
- Workflow fails on 3rd or 4th competitor
- Inconsistent failure (different competitor each time)

**Possible Causes:**
- API rate limiting (Perplexity or Gemini)
- Timeout on specific competitor research
- Transient API errors
- Memory issues (n8n instance)

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check Execution Logs:**
   ```
   n8n → Executions → Find failed execution
   → Click to view details
   → Identify which node failed
   → Read error message
   ```

2. **Identify Pattern:**
   - Does it always fail on same competitor?
   - Does it fail at same node?
   - What time does it fail?

3. **If Random Competitor Fails:**
   - Likely API rate limit or transient error
   - **Solution:** Enable retries on API nodes
   ```
   Node 5 (Perplexity):
   Settings → Retry On Fail → Enable
   - Max Retries: 3
   - Retry Interval: 5000ms
   - Backoff: Exponential

   Node 6 (Gemini):
   Settings → Retry On Fail → Enable
   - Max Retries: 3
   - Retry Interval: 3000ms
   - Backoff: Exponential
   ```

4. **If Same Competitor Always Fails:**
   - Competitor data may have issues
   - **Solution:** Check competitor object
   ```javascript
   // Verify:
   - Valid URL format (https://)
   - No special characters in name
   - Content hub URL accessible
   - Focus areas and keywords not empty
   ```

5. **Add Delays Between Loop Iterations:**
   ```
   Add "Wait" node after Node 8 (Airtable)
   - Duration: 5-10 seconds
   - Prevents API rate limits
   - Only needed if hitting limits
   ```

6. **Check API Status:**
   - Perplexity: https://status.perplexity.ai/
   - Google Cloud: https://status.cloud.google.com/
   - Check for ongoing incidents

**Verification:**
- Re-run workflow with retries enabled
- Monitor execution for all competitors
- Check API dashboards for error rates

   Slack workspace → Apps
   → Search for "Agent-2 SEO Intelligence Bot"
   → If missing, reinstall from Slack API dashboard
   ```

4. **Generate New Token:**
   ```
   Slack API → Your App
   → "Reinstall to Workspace"
   → Get new Bot User OAuth Token
   → Update n8n credential
   ```

**Prevention:**
- Use OAuth2 (auto-refresh) instead of static token
- Monitor Slack app settings for changes
- Document token refresh procedure

### 5.3 Message Too Long

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "message_too_long"
- Notification partially sent or failed
- Message exceeds Slack limits

**Slack Message Limits:**
- Max message length: 40,000 characters
- Max blocks: 50 blocks
- Recommended: <4,000 characters for readability

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Shorten Notification Template:**
   ```
   Node 9 → Message field
   → Remove verbose sections
   → Use summary stats only
   → Link to Airtable for details
   ```

2. **Use Blocks Instead of Text:**
   ```
   Switch to Slack Block Kit:
   → More structured, better formatting
   → Higher character limits
   → Better mobile display
   ```

3. **Dynamic Truncation:**
   ```
   Add code node before Node 9:

## 6. Data Quality Issues

### 6.1 Generic or Unhelpful Analyses

**Symptoms:**
- Executive summaries are vague
- Content gaps not specific
- Recommendations not actionable
- Analysis feels generic

**Possible Causes:**
- Perplexity search too broad
- Gemini prompt needs improvement
- Competitor data incomplete
- Temperature settings incorrect

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Improve Competitor Metadata:**
   ```
   Node 2: Update competitor objects
   → Add more specific focus_areas
   → Include 5-10 primary_keywords (not just 3)
   → Verify content_hub URLs are active
   ```

2. **Refine Perplexity Prompt:**
   ```
   Node 5: Make prompt more specific

   ❌ Generic: "What is their SEO strategy?"
   ✅ Specific: "What 5 keywords do they rank #1-3 for?
                Include search volume and difficulty estimates."
   ```

3. **Enhance Gemini Prompt:**
   ```
   Node 6: Add examples and constraints

   Add to prompt:
   "For each content gap, provide:
   - Specific article title (not just topic)
   - Estimated search volume for target keywords
   - Competitive difficulty (Low/Medium/High)
   - Expected time to rank (3/6/12 months)"
   ```

4. **Adjust Temperature:**
   ```
   Node 6 (Gemini):
   → Current: 0.4
   → Try: 0.5-0.6 for more creative insights
   → Don't exceed 0.7 (too random)
   ```

5. **Narrow Search Recency:**
   ```
   Node 5 (Perplexity):
   → Change searchRecencyFilter from "month" → "week"
   → More current data, more specific insights
   ```

**Verification:**
- Compare before/after analyses quality
- Review with team for actionability
- Track which insights lead to actual content creation

### 6.2 Duplicate Records in Airtable

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple records for same competitor on same date
- Airtable table grows faster than expected
- Workflow ran multiple times unintentionally

**Possible Causes:**
- Workflow executed manually multiple times
- Schedule trigger fired multiple times (rare)
- Loop not exiting properly
- Multiple workflow versions active

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check for Duplicate Workflows:**
   ```
   n8n → Workflows
   → Search: "Agent-2 SEO"
   → Verify only ONE workflow is "Active"
   → Deactivate or delete duplicates
   ```

2. **Review Execution History:**
   ```
   n8n → Executions
   → Filter by workflow
   → Check for multiple executions on same date
   → Identify cause (manual vs scheduled)
   ```

3. **Clean Up Duplicates:**
   ```
   Airtable:
   → Sort by: Competitor Name, Analysis Date
   → Identify duplicates (same name + date)
   → Manually delete older duplicates
   → Keep most recent/complete record
   ```

4. **Add Deduplication Logic (Advanced):**
   ```
   Add code node before Node 8:
   → Query Airtable for existing records
   → Check if record exists for competitor + today's date
   → Skip creation if duplicate found
   → Requires additional Airtable node
   ```

5. **Prevent Future Duplicates:**
   ```
   Create Airtable automation:
   → Trigger: Record created
   → Condition: Duplicate Competitor Name + Analysis Date
   → Action: Delete record + send alert
   ```

**Prevention:**
- Only manual execute when testing
- Verify single active workflow
- Monitor execution logs weekly

### 6.3 JSON Fields Not Parsing

**Symptoms:**
- Content Gaps (JSON) shows as plain text, not structured
- Can't parse JSON in formulas or scripts
- JSON appears with escape characters

**Possible Causes:**
- Gemini output not valid JSON
- Information Extractor (Node 7) failing silently
- Extra formatting/markdown in output
- Character encoding issues

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check Node 7 Output:**
   ```
   n8n → Last execution → Node 7
   → Verify output is clean JSON
   → Look for:
   - No markdown code blocks (```json```)
   - No extra text before/after JSON
   - Valid JSON syntax
   ```

2. **Validate JSON Structure:**
   ```
   Copy output from Node 7
   → Paste into: https://jsonlint.com/
   → Check for errors
   → Common issues:
   - Trailing commas
   - Unescaped quotes in strings
   - Missing brackets
   ```

3. **Improve Gemini Prompt:**
   ```
   Node 6: Make JSON requirement explicit

   Add to end of prompt:
   "CRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
   No markdown formatting.
   No code blocks.
   No additional text before or after.
   Start with { and end with }."
   ```

4. **Add JSON Cleanup Node:**
   ```
   Insert code node between Node 6 and 7:

   let text = $input.item.json.output;
   // Remove markdown code blocks
   text = text.replace(/```json\n?/g, '');
   text = text.replace(/```\n?/g, '');
   // Extract JSON if wrapped
   const match = text.match(/\{[\s\S]*\}/);
   return {
     json: {
       cleaned_output: match ? match[0] : text
     }
   };
   ```

5. **Update Information Extractor Schema:**
   ```
   Node 7:
   → Verify schema matches exactly what Gemini outputs
   → Enable "strict" mode if available
   → Set "removeInvalidFields": false (fail on errors)
   ```

**Verification:**
- Copy JSON from Airtable
- Paste into JSON validator
- Should parse without errors
- Try: `JSON.parse(field_value)` in browser console

## 7. Performance and Timeout Issues

### 7.1 Workflow Takes Too Long (>30 minutes)

**Symptoms:**
- Execution time exceeds 30 minutes
- Workflow times out
- Some competitors not processed

**Target Execution Times:**
- 1 competitor: 3-5 minutes
- 5 competitors: 15-25 minutes
- 7 competitors: 21-35 minutes

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Identify Slow Nodes:**
   ```
   n8n → Execution log
   → Note time spent in each node
   → Common slow nodes:
   - Node 5 (Perplexity): Should be <60s
   - Node 6 (Gemini): Should be <90s
   ```

2. **Optimize Perplexity (Node 5):**
   ```
   Reduce prompt length:
   - Remove examples
   - Shorten instructions
   - Target <800 tokens

   Reduce max tokens:
   - Change from 4000 → 3000

   Narrow search recency:
   - "month" → "week" (faster search)
   ```

3. **Optimize Gemini (Node 6):**
   ```
   Reduce max tokens:
   - Change from 8000 → 6000

   Reduce input size:
   - Summarize Perplexity output before passing
   - Don't include full research (just key points)
   ```

4. **Remove Unnecessary Delays:**
   ```
   Check for Wait nodes
   → Remove if not needed for rate limiting
   → Reduce delay time (10s → 5s)
   ```

5. **Parallel Processing (Advanced):**
   ```
   Instead of sequential loop:
   → Use "Split Out Items" node
   → Process competitors in parallel
   → WARNING: May hit rate limits
   → Only if APIs support concurrency
   ```

**Verification:**
- Monitor next execution time
- Target: <20 minutes for 5 competitors
- Document optimization results

### 7.2 High Memory Usage / Crashes

**Symptoms:**
- n8n instance crashes during execution
- "Out of memory" errors
- Workflow stops unexpectedly

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check n8n Instance Resources:**
   ```bash
   # Check memory usage
   free -h

   # Check n8n process memory
   ps aux | grep n8n

   # Check available disk space
   df -h
   ```

2. **Increase n8n Memory Limit:**
   ```bash
   # For self-hosted (systemd)
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/n8n.service

   # Add or modify:
   Environment="NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096"

   # Restart
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart n8n
   ```

3. **Reduce Data Retention:**
   ```
   n8n Settings → Executions
   → "Save execution progress": Manual executions only
   → "Save data of success executions": 7 days
   → Reduces database size
   ```

4. **Reduce Concurrent Executions:**
   ```
   n8n Settings → Executions
   → Max concurrent executions: 1-2
   → Prevents memory overload
   ```

5. **Optimize Workflow:**
   ```
   - Don't store large data in variables
   - Clear unused data between nodes
   - Reduce logging verbosity
   ```

**Prevention:**
- Monitor n8n instance resources
- Set up memory alerts
- Scale to larger instance if needed
- Consider n8n Cloud (managed infrastructure)

## 8. Cost and Billing Issues

### 8.1 Unexpected High API Costs

**Symptoms:**
- Perplexity bill higher than expected
- Gemini costs exceed $10/month
- Surprise charges on credit card

**Expected Costs (5 competitors, weekly):**
- Perplexity: ~$1.20/month
- Gemini: ~$2.40/month
- Total API: ~$3.60/month

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Audit Execution Frequency:**
   ```
   n8n → Executions
   → Filter last 30 days
   → Count executions
   → Expected: 4-5 per month (weekly)
   → If >10: Investigate duplicate executions
   ```

2. **Check Token Usage:**
   ```
   Perplexity Dashboard:
   → Usage tab
   → Check tokens per request
   → Should be <4,000 tokens/request

   Gemini Dashboard:
   → Google Cloud Console → API Usage
   → Check token metrics
   → Should be <8,000 tokens/request
   ```

3. **Identify Cost Drivers:**
   ```
   Common causes of high costs:
   - ✗ Workflow running hourly instead of weekly
   - ✗ Testing with 10+ competitors
   - ✗ Max tokens set too high (>10,000)
   - ✗ Multiple workflow versions active
   ```

4. **Set Budget Alerts:**
   ```
   Perplexity:
   → Settings → Billing
   → Set usage alerts at $5, $10, $20

   Google Cloud:
   → Billing → Budgets & alerts
   → Set budget: $10/month
   → Alerts at 50%, 90%, 100%
   ```

5. **Optimize for Cost:**
   ```
   Reduce frequency:
   → Weekly → Bi-weekly (50% savings)

   Reduce competitors:
   → 5 → 3 competitors (40% savings)

   Use cheaper models:
   → Gemini 2.0 Flash → 1.5 Flash (cheaper)
   → Sonar Pro → Sonar (if quality acceptable)
   ```

**Verification:**
- Check next month's costs
- Verify charges match execution count
- Document baseline costs for comparison

### 8.2 Free Tier Limits Exceeded

**Symptoms:**
- Gemini: "Quota exceeded" errors
- Workflow fails mid-execution
- Daily/monthly limits reached

**Gemini Free Tier Limits:**
- 15 requests/minute
- 1,500 requests/day
- 1 million tokens/month

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Calculate Current Usage:**
   ```
   Weekly execution:
   - 5 competitors × 1 request each = 5 requests
   - 5 × ~6,000 tokens = ~30,000 tokens

   Monthly usage:
   - 4 weeks × 5 requests = 20 requests
   - 4 weeks × 30,000 tokens = 120,000 tokens

   ✅ Well within free tier
   ```

2. **Check for Unexpected Usage:**
   ```
   Google Cloud Console:
   → API Dashboard
   → Check daily request pattern
   → Look for spikes or unexpected usage
   ```

3. **Request Quota Increase:**
   ```
   Google Cloud Console:
   → IAM & Admin → Quotas
   → Filter: Generative Language API
   → Request increase (usually free)
   ```

4. **Upgrade to Paid Tier:**
   ```
   Enable billing on Google Cloud project
   → Costs still minimal (~$2-3/month)
   → No more quota restrictions
   → Pay-as-you-go
   ```

**Prevention:**
- Monitor quota usage weekly
- Set alerts at 50% of quota
- Plan for paid tier if scaling
